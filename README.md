# UAMSNet for Abdominal Multi-organ Segmentation

Segmenting abdominal organs from computer tomography (CT) is essential for computer-assisted diagnosis, surgical planning, and radiation therapy.  Radiologists or oncologists manually delineate organ segmentation in their clinical practice.  This is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, and it often suffers from large inter observer variations, especially for various categories of abdominal organs.  Moreover, inexperienced doctors can easily miss diagnoses or misidentify, which may bring certain risks to the patient's life. Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need for accurate automatic organ segmentation methods
